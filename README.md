## Weather Dashboard Challenge 06

# Introduction
This application is a simple dashboard that allows users to input a city and see the current and 5 day weather forcast. I ran out of time and did not implement the search history or clear history funcitons.

# Deployed Application
The deployed application can be viewed here: https://ackermanjs.github.io/WeatherAppChallenge06/

# Functionality
Load the page from the link and use the search function to query your city. It will display current weather and the 5 day forcast.
